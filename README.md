# About Me

Greetings! I am an undergraduate student at William & Mary studying data science and computer science. Over time, I have developed skills and interests in data analysis and storytelling, machine learning, natural language processing, and software development. I thrive on tackling challenges and finding innovative solutions that make a positive impact.
